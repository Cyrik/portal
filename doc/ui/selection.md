# Selection

A single click will select a value. The arrow keys, (`⭠` `⭣` `⭡` `⭢`) or (`h`
`j` `k` `l`) will change the selection relative to the currently selected value.
Relative selection is based on the viewer.

## Multi-Select

To select multiple values, hold down either `⌘` or `alt` and single click a
value. To un-select a value, simply click it again while holding down the
multi-select key. The order of selection is important to the application of
commands.
