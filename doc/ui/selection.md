# Selection

A single click will select a value. The arrow keys, (`⭠` `⭣` `⭡` `⭢`) or (`h`
`j` `k` `l` for vim folks) will change the selection relative to the currently
selected value. Relative selection is based on the [viewer](./viewers.md).

Selection is an important concept in the Portal UI since it is the basis for a
lot of the other concepts.

## Multi-Select

To select multiple values, hold down either `⌘` or `alt` and single click a
value. To un-select a value, simply click it again while holding down the
multi-select key. The order of selection is important to the application of
[commands](./commands.md).
