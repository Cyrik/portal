# Themes

There are currently three built-in themes:

- [`:portal.colors/nord`](https://www.nordtheme.com/) (default)
- [`:portal.colors/solarized-dark`](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/)
- [`:portal.colors/solarized-light`](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/)
- [`:portal.colors/zerodark`](https://github.com/NicolasPetton/zerodark-theme)

Which can be passed as an option to `p/open`:

```clojure
(p/open
  {:theme :portal.colors/nord})
```
