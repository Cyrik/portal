# Filtering

![Screen Shot 2022-09-20 at 10 50 55 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1986211/191424638-967fa72b-9932-4073-a5f4-b8050313a7d7.png)

Like many concepts listed above, filtering is relative to the currently selected
value. If no value is selected, filtering is disabled. When a collection is
selected, the filter text will act to remove elements from that collection,
similar to the command palette.

Since multiple collections can be filtered at once, the input will change color
and matched words in the collection and its children will be highlighted with
that color.

To remove the current filters, try the [`portal.ui.commands/clear-filter`](./commands.md)
command.
